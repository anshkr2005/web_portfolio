                I&apos;‚Äôm Ansh Kumar ‚Äî a passionate developer with a strong focus on creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly applications. With several years of experience in web development, I specialize in building modern web applications using the latest technologies. I take pride in crafting clean, efficient, and scalable code that brings ideas to life and enhances user experiences.

My journey in tech began when I discovered my passion for problem-solving and creating digital experiences. Since then, I‚Äôve worked on numerous projects, constantly learning and improving my skills to deliver high-quality solutions.

Currently pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I bring a dynamic blend of leadership, innovation, and hands-on experience in development and real-world problem-solving.

Over the years, I‚Äôve led from the front ‚Äî as the Student Placement Coordinator at GITM, President of the Social Insights Club, Joint Secretary of Capture Crew, and CS Tech Manager at Team Sankalp. Each role has shaped me into a collaborative leader who thrives on turning ideas into impactful results.

I‚Äôve proven my technical and creative strengths by securing:

ü•á 1st Place at Hackcraft for building a meaningful tech solution.

ü•à 2nd Place at Code Sangam, where we explored Blockchain and Cybersecurity.

Participation in prestigious hackathons like Code4Cause and Code4Cause 2.0.

              <motion.p variants={itemVariants} className="text-foreground/80 mb-8">
              My technical toolbox includes Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, and frontend web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&apos;ve also gained hands-on experience in business intelligence tools through virtual internships and simulations with PwC, Tata, Accenture, KPMG, and British Airways.

What drives me is more than just writing code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about solving real problems, making a positive impact, and growing with every challenge. I believe in leading with purpose, building with passion, and always staying curious.

Let‚Äôs connect, collaborate, and innovate together. üöÄ
